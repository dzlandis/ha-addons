3. **Start the add-on**: The service will automatically detect and serve your content
4. **Access content**: 
   - **Via sidebar**: Click "Kiwix" in the Home Assistant sidebar (recommended)
   - **Direct access**: Open `http://homeassistant.local:8080` in your browser

### ZIM Files

ZIM files are compressed archives containing offline content. Popular options include:

- **Wiktionary**: Multilingual dictionary and thesaurus
- **TED Talks**: Educational talks with transcripts
- **Project Gutenberg**: Collection of free ebooks
- **Stack Overflow**: Programming questions and answers

### File Management

ZIM files can be large (several GB). Ensure you have sufficient storage space:

1. Check available space in Home Assistant
2. Consider storing files on external storage if needed
3. Remove unused ZIM files to free up space

#### ZIM Management Helper

The add-on includes a built-in helper script for managing ZIM files. You can access it through the Home Assistant SSH add-on or terminal:

```bash
# List all ZIM files
kiwix-helper list

# Show information about a specific ZIM file
kiwix-helper info wikipedia_en_all_2023-01.zim

# Show total size of all ZIM files
kiwix-helper size

# Check for broken or invalid ZIM files
kiwix-helper check

# Show help
kiwix-helper help
```

### Sidebar Integration

The Kiwix add-on integrates seamlessly with Home Assistant through the ingress feature. Once the add-on is running, you'll see a "Kiwix" entry in your Home Assistant sidebar. This provides:

- **Easy access**: No need to remember ports or URLs
- **Seamless integration**: Works with Home Assistant authentication
- **Consistent experience**: Matches the look and feel of other Home Assistant interfaces

The sidebar entry uses a book icon (ðŸ“–) and is accessible to all users (not just administrators).

### Troubleshooting

**No content visible?**
- Ensure ZIM files are in the correct directory
- Check that file extensions are `.zim`
- Verify file permissions allow reading
- Restart the add-on after adding new files

**Cannot access the web interface?**
- **Sidebar integration**: Look for "Kiwix" in your Home Assistant sidebar
- Verify the port is not blocked by firewall (for direct access)
- Check if another service is using the same port
- Review add-on logs for error messages

**Interface looks broken in sidebar?**
- This usually indicates CSS/JS loading issues in ingress mode
- Check the add-on logs for "URL root location" messages
- Try restarting the add-on
- If issues persist, try accessing via direct URL first, then sidebar

**Add-on won't start?**
- Check configuration syntax
- Ensure library path exists and is accessible
- Review Home Assistant supervisor logs
