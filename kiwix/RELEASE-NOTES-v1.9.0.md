# Kiwix Home Assistant Add-on v1.9.0 - Release Summary

## Key Fix: Complete Asset Loading Solution

This version completely resolves the asset loading issues that were preventing CSS, JavaScript, and other resources from loading correctly in the Home Assistant interface.

### The Problem (Previous Versions)
- Kiwix generated absolute URLs like `/skin/kiwix.css`
- These were being requested directly to `homeassistant.local:8123/skin/kiwix.css`  
- Home Assistant couldn't serve these assets, resulting in 404 errors
- UI appeared broken with no styling or JavaScript functionality

### The Solution (v1.9.0)
- **Dynamic Ingress Token Extraction**: nginx captures the unique ingress token from each request
- **HTML Content Rewriting**: All asset URLs are automatically rewritten to use full ingress paths
- **Complete Coverage**: Handles all types of assets: CSS, JS, images, API calls, forms

### Technical Details
```
Request Flow:
1. User visits: /api/hassio_ingress/[TOKEN]/
2. nginx extracts TOKEN and forwards request to kiwix-serve
3. kiwix-serve returns HTML with URLs like /skin/kiwix.css
4. nginx rewrites these to /api/hassio_ingress/[TOKEN]/skin/kiwix.css
5. Browser requests assets through correct ingress path
6. Assets load successfully, UI works perfectly
```

### Expected Results
- ✅ All CSS styling loads correctly
- ✅ JavaScript functionality works (search, navigation, etc.)
- ✅ Images and icons display properly
- ✅ Search forms and API calls function
- ✅ Complete offline Wikipedia/content browsing experience
- ✅ Seamless integration with Home Assistant sidebar

### Testing Checklist
When testing v1.9.0, verify:
- [ ] Page loads with full styling (not plain HTML)
- [ ] Search functionality works
- [ ] Navigation between articles works
- [ ] Images in articles display
- [ ] No 404 errors in browser developer console
- [ ] All UI elements (buttons, menus) are styled correctly

This should be the definitive solution to the ingress asset loading challenges!
