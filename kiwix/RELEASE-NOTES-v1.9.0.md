# Kiwix Home Assistant Add-on v1.10.0 - Release Summary

## The Ultimate Fix: Multi-Location nginx Strategy

This version takes a completely different approach to solve the asset loading problem by using multiple nginx location blocks to handle different asset types with proper MIME type headers.

### The Root Cause (Discovered)
Your browser error logs revealed the real issue:
- CSS files were being served with MIME type `text/plain` instead of `text/css`
- JavaScript files had incorrect MIME types
- This caused browsers to refuse to load the stylesheets and scripts
- The 404 errors were secondary to the MIME type problems

### The New Solution (v1.10.0)
- **Asset-Specific nginx Locations**: Separate location blocks for CSS, JS, and image files
- **Forced MIME Types**: Explicitly sets `Content-Type: text/css` for CSS files and `Content-Type: application/javascript` for JS files
- **Priority Routing**: Most specific patterns matched first (CSS, JS, images, then general assets)
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Handles all asset types that Kiwix uses

### Technical Details
```
nginx Location Priority:
1. /api/hassio_ingress/TOKEN/skin/*.css → Force MIME type text/css
2. /api/hassio_ingress/TOKEN/skin/*.js → Force MIME type application/javascript  
3. /api/hassio_ingress/TOKEN/skin/*.{svg,png,ico} → Handle images
4. /api/hassio_ingress/TOKEN/skin/* → Handle other assets
5. /api/hassio_ingress/TOKEN/* → Handle main pages + HTML rewriting
```

### Expected Results
- ✅ No more "MIME type not supported" errors
- ✅ CSS files load with correct `text/css` MIME type
- ✅ JavaScript files load with correct `application/javascript` MIME type
4. nginx rewrites these to /api/hassio_ingress/[TOKEN]/skin/kiwix.css
5. Browser requests assets through correct ingress path
6. Assets load successfully, UI works perfectly
```

- ✅ No more "MIME type not supported" errors
- ✅ CSS files load with correct `text/css` MIME type
- ✅ JavaScript files load with correct `application/javascript` MIME type
- ✅ All assets route through proper ingress paths
- ✅ Complete Kiwix UI functionality restored
- ✅ No more 404 errors for assets

### Testing Checklist
When testing v1.10.0, verify:
- [ ] Page loads with full styling (no longer plain HTML)
- [ ] No MIME type errors in browser console
- [ ] No 404 errors for CSS/JS files
- [ ] Search functionality works
- [ ] All UI elements properly styled
- [ ] Images and icons display correctly

This dual-approach solution (asset routing + MIME type fixing) should finally resolve all ingress asset loading issues!
